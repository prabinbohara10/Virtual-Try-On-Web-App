# Virtual-Try-On-Web-App

"Virtual Try-On Using Generative Modeling" leverages computer vision and 
Generative Modeling techniques to revolutionize the fashion industry. It offers users a 
real-time, immersive experience for trying on virtual clothing items. The person 
representation module is implemented with OpenPose and DeepLabV3+ architecture 
for the purpose of key-point detection and image segmentation respectively. By 
employing geometric matching techniques, TPS algorithms and cloth refinement using 
Style Aggregator Modules, the system accurately captures users' body shapes, 
dynamically maps clothing items onto virtual representations, and simulates realistic 
fabric behavior. Inclusion of Depth Estimation Module to estimate depth of a person 
from their image paves the path for construction of 3D representation of try-on output. 
The incorporation of disentangled encodings enables personalized customization by 
manipulating independent clothing attributes. Through extensive evaluations, we 
demonstrate the effectiveness and visual fidelity of Virtual Try-On, highlighting its 
potential to reshape online shopping, enhance customer engagement, and transform the 
way fashion is experienced.
